<pre>
Encrypts your binary file and embeds them to a Crypto file dropper to bypass detection.

Usage: tott.exe [mode] -e [encryption] -a [architecture] -ico [file] -i [file in] -o [file out] -kl [integer] -requireadmin
 * [mode] should always be the first argument given

[mode] :: Sets the mode of the application
--help :: shows the help dialogue
--load  :: Encrypt and load a file
--cleanup :: clear up space by deleting all the temporary files

[load arguments]
-i [file in] :: File path of the file to be loaded and encrypted
-e [encryption] :: Encryption to use :: 3des, aes128, aes192, aes256, des, rc2, rc4 :: Default encryption aes128
-o [file out] :: File output destination after encryption and file load process
-a [architecture] :: Compiled executable architecture :: x86, x64 :: Default architecture x86
-ico [file] :: Compiled executable icon :: Default icon [blank icon]
-kl [integer] :: Key length to be used for the encryption :: Default length 64
-requireadmin :: Flags the compiled application to require administrative priviledges
